# Readme
Generate the Dokka docs locally for this library by running the `dokkaHtml` task like so:
```shell
./gradlew :lib:dokkaHtml
```

View your docs in the `./lib/build/dokka/html` directory (note that you need a live local server to have them render properly).

See the example docs [here](https://thunderbiscuit.github.io/kalculator-dokka-sample/).
